IEC 61499 distributed application function blocks for industrial process measurement and control systems and event driven PLC extension

IEC 61499 enables an application-centric design, in which one or more applications, defined by networks of interconnected function blocks, are created for the whole system and subsequently distributed to the available devices.

IEC 61499-1 defines the architecture for distributed systems.

IEC 61499-2 defines requirements for software tools to be compliant to IEC 61499

IEC 61499-3 (2008 withdrawn) This part answered FAQs related to the IEC 61499 standard and described the use of IEC 61499 elements with examples to solve common challenges during the engineering of automation systems.

IEC 61499-4 describes the rules that a system, device or software tool must follow to be compliant to IEC 61499. These rules are related to interoperability, portability and configuration.
